# Getting Started with LHT React Tailwind Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Node.js v16 or higher (Recommended v18)

## Recommended VSCode Extensions

To enhance your development experience, we recommend using the following VSCode extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Integrates ESLint, a linter for JavaScript and JSX, to identify and fix problems in your code.
- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Provides automatic code formatting according to your project's configuration.
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss): Offers enhanced IntelliSense and autocompletion for Tailwind CSS classes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm run start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
